sabre/amf
=========

sabre/amf is a AMF server/client for PHP. AMF stands for Action Message Format,
and is the format Flash/ActionScript uses for communicating with servers
(a.k.a. remoting).

This project is largely unmaintained since 2009, as both flash and this method
of communication has fallen out of favor. It's kept around because it should
still work.

Some information about this can be found [on my blog][1]
